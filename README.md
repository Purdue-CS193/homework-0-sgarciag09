# CS 193 Homework 0 - GitHub and Your Own Website!

## What is this assignment

Throughout this homework, you will create a personal GitHub account, use that GitHub account to modify some code from the homework repository, and then submit it to us for grading! This same basic process will be used throughout CS193 to complete and turn in all of your homework. For this first one, we're focusing on getting you used to the process.

## When is this due?

Please refer to BrightSpace for the due date information.

## When will I know that I'm done

When you have a GitHub account, submitted your GitHub username, and have a website with all the info required. The info is described later in the assignment. We will be using the same link you use to view your website to grade it.

## Heads up!

You should only continue from here if everything went smoothly from the instructions in the PDF on Brightspace.  If things did not go smoothly then revisit those instructions and finish up all the steps it lists first!

## Step 4 - Create Your Own Website!

The repository that was just created for you is already set up with a simple file that displays a basic website. The website content is found in the `index.md` file. Throughout this homework, you will be editing this file to create your own content for this website.

To activate the website so you can visit it in a browser, click on the **Purdue-CS193/homework-0-\<Your Github Username\>** repository from your GitHub home page. On the top part of the repository page, click on the **Settings** tab. 

Before you can create a GitHub Page, you must make your repository public. You can do this at the bottom of the Settings tab in the section labeled **Danger Zone**. Once there, find the option labeled 'Change repository visibility'. Click the 'Change visibility' button to the right and select the 'make public' option. Confirm it by typing the confirmation message, and you are good to go!

Scroll down to the section in Settings called **GitHub Pages**. Change the **Source** setting to the option called **master** and click save. At this point, you can navigate to `https://Purdue-CS193.github.io/homework-0-<Your Github Username>/` to view the website you just activated!

Right now, there isn't any meaningful content on this website, just a placeholder that tells you a little about what you can do with the website template.

## Step 5 - Edit Your Website

Having just a template website is pretty boring. To edit your website to display more interesting content, go back to the main page for the **Purdue-CS193/homework-0-\<Your Github Username\>** repository.

From here, click on the `index.md` file. You should see the same content you viewed at `https://Purdue-CS193.github.io/homework-0-<Your Github Username>/` except this time it is not themed.

To edit this file, click on the **edit** button (it looks like a little pencil) in the upper right-hand corner of the file display. This will open a text editor where you can change the contents of the website to whatever you want. Take a few minutes to experiment with the different formatting tools that the website template tells you are available.

To save your changes so that they will display on your website, fill out the **Commit Changes** form at the bottom by describing what you changed on the website. Select the option called **Commit directly to the master branch** and click **Commit changes**. If all is well, you should be able to navigate back to `https://Purdue-CS193.github.io/homework-0-<Your Github Username>/` and view the changes you made.

**Your changes may not load immediately. If you do not see any changes, hit <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> (or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> on macs).**

## Step 6 - The Graded Part (**THIS PART IS WHAT WE ARE ACTUALLY GRADING**)

When you're ready, create a **heading** (a heading is some text that is preceded by a `# `, note the space after the #) to title your website
**\<Your Name\>'s First CS193 Homework**

Next, create a bulleted list of some of your favorite things about CS193 (if you don't have any, I'll be sad :( but try to make some up anyway).  Bulleted lists are a series of lines that each start with a `- ` followed by your text.  You can see an example in `index.md`.

We have provided a simple Markdown syntax guide and other useful resources in the `index.md`. The syntax guide is in the code block, which begins and ends with ` ``` ` (three backticks or one for inline code block) and interprets text literally (*italicize syntax, not in code block* v.s. `*italicize syntax, in code block*`). Feel free to keep or delete the guide, but **make sure not to put actual website contents inside of the code block**.

When you're done, commit your changes, just as you did above and you're done! **CONGRATULATIONS** you just completed your first CS193 homework :) Give yourself a pat on the back and bask in the glory of your brand-new fancy GitHub Website!

## Optional Extra - Change the Theme of Your Website

If you aren't a fan of the super cool hacker theme that I chose to be the default of your website, you can easily change it.
Navigate to the settings page for your **Purdue-CS193/homework-0-\<Your Github Username\>** and scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section. Click on **Change theme** and pick your favorite theme!
